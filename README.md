## Hyundai_Car_Predication

## Introduction
The Car Price Prediction Model project is aimed at developing a machine learning model that can accurately predict the selling price of used cars based on a range of factors, such as car make and model, mileage, age, condition, and location.

## Tech stack used:
- Python & Pandas (for data wrangling)
- Pandas, Sklearn, Seaborn, Matplotib (for understanding data and building models).

## Exploratory Data analysis
The project will involve a large dataset of Hyundai car sales in which we build a linear regression model to predict the price of Hyundai cars . The data will be cleaned, preprocessed, and transformed into a format suitable for machine learning analysis.

## Model Building
The Car Price Prediction Model will use machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression , to analyze the data and generate predictions about the selling price of Hyundai cars. The model will be trained using a subset of the data, and its accuracy will be validated using a separate test dataset.

The key features of the Car Price Prediction Model project will include data collection and cleaning, model development and optimization, and model validation and testing.

The Car Price Prediction Model project aims to provide users with an accurate and reliable tool for predicting the selling price of their used cars. By leveraging the power of machine learning and data analysis, the project will help users make informed decisions about buying and selling cars, and it will help car dealerships and private sellers optimize their pricing strategies.

## Challenges & Learning
- Finding the Best regression model among Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression(SVR).
- We have to learn SVR ( SVR) model since we aren't familiar with it.
- Reconstructing the given dataset. changing categorical values into numerical form by using one hot encoding.
- We learn Team Management and Cohesive teamwork throughout this project.
